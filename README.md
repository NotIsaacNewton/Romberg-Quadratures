# Romberg-Quadratures
A Python program for numerical integration using Romberg Quadratures and trapezoidal sums.

This can be run in a Jupiter Notebook, with the method for integration saved as a seperate file called integrate.py. To use the program simply give it the starting and endpoints, a and b, and the starting number of steps. To define a function to integrate, go to line 9, where f(x) is defined and change the part after y= (default is y=x\*\*2, which is y=x^2). After defining the endpoints, the number of steps, and the function, run the program. There will be two outputs: The Romberg Quadrature array and the most accurate result. In the main while loop, at line 26, 0.001 can be changed to bigger or smaller numbers for less or more accuracy, respectively. One more thing to note is that Part II, which is the integrate.py file, also includes a midpoint method of integration, which can be useful to compare its accuracy and efficiency with that of the Romberg Quadratures method.
