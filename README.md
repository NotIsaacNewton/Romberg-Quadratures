# Romberg-Quadratures
A Python program for numerical integration using Romberg Quadratures and trapezoidal sums.

This can be run in Spyder, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc., with the method for integration saved as a seperate file called methods.py (save both files to same directory). To use the program simply give it the starting and endpoints, a and b, and the starting number of steps. To define a function to integrate, go to line 22, where f(x) is defined and change the part after y= (default is y=np.tanh(x), which is the hyperbolic tangent). After defining the endpoints, the number of steps, and the function, run the program. There will be three outputs: The Romberg Quadrature array, the most accurate result, and the graph of the funciton. In the main while loop, at line 43, 0.001 can be changed to bigger or smaller numbers for less or more accuracy, respectively. One more thing to note is that methods.py also includes a midpoint method of integration, which can be useful to compare its accuracy and efficiency with that of the Romberg Quadratures method with trapezoidal sums.
